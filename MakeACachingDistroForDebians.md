Yes, it is possible to set up a caching proxy server on your network to optimize updates and upgrades for your Kali Linux and Ubuntu systems. This way, the first system fetches the required packages from the internet, and subsequent systems fetch them from the local cache, significantly reducing internet bandwidth usage. Here’s how you can achieve this:

---

### 1. **Install and Configure `apt-cacher-ng`**
`apt-cacher-ng` is a lightweight caching proxy for APT repositories, suitable for your use case.

#### Installation:
On the system you want to use as the caching server:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-cacher-ng
```

#### Configuration:
The default configuration usually works well, but you can customize it if needed:
- The main configuration file is at `/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf`.
- Make sure `BindAddress: 0.0.0.0` is set to allow connections from other devices in the network.

Restart the service after changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apt-cacher-ng
```

#### Check if it’s running:
Open a browser on another system and navigate to:
```
http://<server-ip>:3142/acng-report.html
```
This will show the status of `apt-cacher-ng`.

---

### 2. **Configure Clients to Use the Cache**
On each Kali or Ubuntu system in your network:

#### Edit or create `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy`:
```bash
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<server-ip>:3142";
```
Replace `<server-ip>` with the IP address of the caching server.

#### Test:
Run an update:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
The output should show that packages are being fetched through the proxy.

---

### 3. **Handling HTTPS Repositories (Optional)**
If your repositories use HTTPS (common in modern configurations), you'll need additional configuration.

#### Allow HTTPS Repositories via `apt-cacher-ng`:
Edit `/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf` and ensure:
```text
PassThroughPattern: .*
```

#### Configure APT on Clients:
Instead of using the proxy for HTTPS directly, you can set up your system to allow HTTPS passthrough by using tools like `squid-deb-proxy` or similar solutions. Alternatively, use the `http://` protocol if available in repository URLs.

---

### 4. **Verification**
To ensure the caching works:
- The first client fetches the updates and stores them in the cache.
- Subsequent clients should fetch the packages much faster, as they’re pulled from the cache.

---

### 5. **Maintenance**
You might want to monitor and clean the cache periodically:
```bash
sudo apt-cacher-ng -c
sudo apt-cacher-ng -R
```

This solution effectively sets up a progressive mirror for your network without downloading unnecessary files, making it lightweight and efficient.
